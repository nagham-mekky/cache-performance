2. Report.pdf: A PDF file that contains all the data analysis, design and functions extracted from the output of the cache simulator.

## How to build


### Test case
To run the test case, the user should change the DRAM size to (64 * 1024), change the cache size to 64, the cache line size to 16, and the number of ways to 2. In the main function, the user should change the number of iterations to 15, and use the function called memGenTestCase() as the generator. All of these can be found within the comments in the code.
